title: "The Reflection of Ruin"
introduction: |
  The Investigators are drawn to "Dust & Echoes," a newly opened antique shop in the quiet town of Arkham. The shop's owner, Silas Blackwood, is an eccentric collector with a penchant for the macabre. A recent acquisition, an ornate Victorian-era mirror, is drawing a lot of attention, but not the kind Silas was hoping for. Customers report unsettling visions when gazing into its depths, and Silas himself has become increasingly withdrawn and paranoid. The Investigators might be antique collectors, friends of Silas, or simply curious about the strange rumors surrounding the mirror.

plot_outline: |
  The scenario begins with the Investigators arriving at Dust & Echoes. They will quickly learn about the mirror and the disturbing visions it induces. Silas Blackwood, initially eager to show off his prize, becomes increasingly frantic as the Investigators delve deeper into the mirror's history. The Investigators will need to research the mirror's origins, decipher cryptic symbols on its frame, and ultimately confront the malevolent entity trapped within the glass. The entity seeks to escape its prison by manipulating the fears and desires of those who gaze upon it, showing them visions of their own demise. As the Investigators get closer to the truth, they will experience increasingly vivid and terrifying visions, testing their sanity and resolve. The climax involves a ritual to either destroy the mirror and banish the entity or, in a darker turn, allow the entity to fully manifest in the world.

    description: |
      The air in Dust & Echoes is thick with the scent of dust, old paper, and mothballs. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the grime-coated windows, casting the room in a perpetual twilight. Shelves overflow with forgotten treasures: chipped porcelain dolls, tarnished silver cutlery, stacks of yellowed books, and antique clocks frozen in time. A grandfather clock ticks with unnerving slowness in the corner, each tick echoing through the cluttered space.

    description: |
      The back room is significantly darker and more cluttered than the front. Piles of unopened boxes and shrouded furniture fill the space, creating a maze of shadows. The air is heavy with the smell of damp earth and decay. In the center of the room, resting on a velvet-draped pedestal, stands the mirror. It is a large, ornate Victorian-era mirror with a heavy, dark wood frame carved with grotesque figures and unsettling symbols. The glass is unusually clear and reflective, drawing the eye into its depths.
