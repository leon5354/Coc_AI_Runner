  at the old Corbitt House on Exeter Street in Arkham. Locals whisper of
  dark rituals and a malevolent presence within the decaying structure.

scenes:
  - description: >
      The exterior of the Corbitt House is a chilling sight. Overgrown with
      ivy, the house seems to loom over the street, casting long shadows.
      The windows are dark and empty, giving the impression of vacant eyes
      staring out into the night. A sense of unease settles upon anyone
      who approaches.

    clues:
      - A broken window pane on the ground floor.
      - Strange symbols etched into the front door.

  - description: >
      Inside, the Corbitt House is filled with the musty odor of decay.
      Dust motes dance in the faint light filtering through the grimy windows.
      The air is heavy with a sense of foreboding.

    clues:
      - A dusty, overturned table in the living room.
      - Faint whispers that seem to come from the walls.
